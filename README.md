# hand-gesture-controlled-drone

Source code for a drone controller in the form of a glove which operates the drone using a gyroscope, a flex sensor, and digital potentiometers.

Utilized sensor data to manuever the drone with driver's specific hand gestures.

Established serial communication between Arduino and sensors using the SPI protocol.

Developed methods for filtering erratic sensor data to allow optimal responsiveness.
